## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->


Using the support from this proposal, we will take our existing tool for calculating volatility of compounds and expand its usage to make predictions for essentially any compound, and enable researchers in a wide variety of fields to use it with ease. 
The current version of `volcalc` can estimate volatility only for compounds in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.
However, by refactoring existing code, we can make the volatility prediction functionality available to any compound with a known structure.
Additionally, we plan to improve package infrastructure and documentation (e.g. increased test coverage, continuous integration, vignettes), build the package on r-universe, and submit the package to CRAN to improve discoverability and simplify installation.

The current version of `volcalc` was created in 2022 as part of a [data science incubator](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/cct-data-science-incubator) project in collaboration between Dr. Kristina Riemer and Dr. Laura Meredith at University of Arizona. 
`volcalc` is developed on GitHub and distributed under an MIT license.
`volcalc` is the first project, to our knowledge, to implement the SIMPOL method for predicting chemical vapor pressures and enthalpies of vaporization [@pankowSIMPOLSimpleGroup2008] in an R package.
`volcalc` has been successfully used to calculate volatility estimates for *all* 19,000+ compounds in the KEGG database with available masses [@meredith]. 
To ensure accuracy of the package, the volatility estimates for a subset of the compounds were validated against hand-collected data [@meredith2022; @honeker2021]. 

The **first minimum viable product** is a function that can calculate volatility when provided a path to a molfile and a package vignette demonstrating how to couple this with chemical data sources such as the `webchem` package.
The main function in `volcalc`, `calc_vol()`, currently works by downloading a molfile from the KEGG API given a KEGG-specific chemical identifier as a starting point.
Molfile is an open file format for storing chemical structure data, and various tools exist to translate other standard representations of chemical structure such as SMILES [@weininger1988smiles] and InChI [@heller2013] to molfiles.
This translation can be done using  [`ChemmineOB`](https://github.com/girke-lab/ChemmineOB) which is already a dependency of `volcalc`. SMILES and InChl are both string representations, so adding these as possible inputs will make `volcalc` fit more easily into a `data.frame`-based workflow.

The **second minimum viable product** is a package that has gone through the steps suggested by `usethis::use_release_issue()` and is ready to submit to CRAN.

Refactoring the code in `volcalc` to work with essentially any chemical and preparing the package for wider distribution will make this powerful tool accessible to researchers across a variety of domains.
