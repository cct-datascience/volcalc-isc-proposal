Version ___ of `volcalc` was created in ____ as part of a [data science incubator](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/cct-data-science-incubator) project in collaboration between Dr. Kristina Riemer and Dr. Laura Meredith at University of Arizona.  `volcalc` is the first project, to our knowledge, to implement the SIMPOL method for predicting chemical vapor pressures and enthalpies of vaporization [@pankowSIMPOLSimpleGroup2008] in an R package. This current version of the `volcalc` package has been successfully used to calculate volatiliy estimates for *all* <!-- big number --> compounds in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. However, in its current form, it is limited to only working with chemical compounds in KEGG. This project will generalize this functionality of `volcalc` to work with any chemical---not just those in the KEGG database. `volcalc` currently downloads chemical information as molfiles from the KEGG API as a starting point.  Molfile is an open format and various tools exist to translate other standard representations of chemical structure such as SMILES and InChIKey to molfiles (e.g. using the [`OpenBabel`](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) command line utility or in R with [`ChemmineOB`](https://github.com/girke-lab/ChemmineOB)). Refactoring the code in `volcalc` to work with *any* molfile and preparing the package for wider distribution will make this powerful tool accessible to researchers across a variety of domains.

The current version of `volcalc` focuses specifically on estimating volatility of compounds in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.  The main function in `volcalc`, `calc_vol()` downloads chemical structure data using the KEGG API as a .mol file. It then reads that .mol file in and parses it to find functional groups.  It then applies an algorithm (published in @pankowSIMPOLSimpleGroup2008) to predict vapor pressure, and outputs to the user a relative measure of volatility.  Other functionality in the package includes ...



`volcalc` is developed on GitHub and distributed under an MIT license. <!-- really need to make a release before the proposal deadline! -->

### Project Goals
Our goals for the proposed project fall into two main categories: 1) to make `volcalc` useful for applications beyond estimating relative volatility for compounds in the KEGG database, and 2) polishing the package in preparation for an initial submission to CRAN.

For the first goal, we will focus on decoupling the data access and volatility estimation functionality of existing code in the `volcalc` package. This code is already written and the main work here is in mindfully re-factoring. The minimum viable product here is a function that can calculate volatility when provided a path to a .mol file and a vignette demonstrating how to couple this with chemical data sources such as the `webchem` package.

The second goal will involve improving test coverage (although current coverage is high at 96.88% as reported by `covr::package_coverage()`), establishing continuous integration with GitHub actions, improving documentation, and satisfying R CMD check.  The minimum viable product here is a package that has gone through the steps suggested by `usethis::use_release_issue()` and is ready to submit to CRAN.

A reach goal is to allow users to input other chemical structure representations besides molfiles. The `ChemmineOB` package can translate a variety of chemical structure representations to molfiles and is already an indirect dependency of `volcalc` through its dependency on `ChemmineR`.  Adding an argument to our `volcalc` function to specify the input format, and passing it to `ChemmineOB`'s translation function would be a way to expand the usability of `volcalc` even further.
