# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->
We would consider this project successful if the `volcalc` package when a version has been released on GitHub, code has been archived on Zenodo, and th package has been successfully submitted to CRAN.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

The following can be used to measure success:

- Is it easy to install the package and use it? (yes/no)
- 

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

- visualizations?
- present at a conferences or teaching people to use it
- what publications could this enable

## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

- The project could be delayed if contributors ended up able to devote less time to the project than planned
- The SIMPOL algorithm might not be applicable to all compounds.  We may need to add some checks in the case that values returned by `volcalc` may not make sense for certain compounds. <!--????-->
